          The <code>&lsquo;animateColor&rsquo;</code> and
          <code>&lsquo;animateTransform&rsquo;</code> elements are deprecated.
          Can we get rid of <code>&lsquo;animateMotion&rsquo;</code> too?

      <h2>Animations in elements referenced by a
          <code>&lsquo;use&rsquo;</code> element</h2>
      <p>
        The usual behavior for <code>&lsquo;use&rsquo;</code> elements
        is that the referenced content is effectively deeply cloned into
        a separate non-exposed DOM tree.
        However, <code>AnimInstance</code> objects produced by the cloned tree
        are exposed in the animation tree after first being wrapped in
        a parallel <code>AnimGroupInstance</code> object with <var>start
        time</var> of zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <code>AnimInstance</code> objects attached to the referenced
        content are never cloned.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in the following fragment,
      </p>
      <pre>&lt;g id="a"/&gt;
  &lt;animate id="b"/&gt;
  &lt;animate id="c"/&gt;
&lt;/g&gt;
&lt;seq&gt;
  &lt;use href="#a"/&gt;
  &lt;animate id="d"/&gt;
&lt;/seq&gt;</pre>
      <p>
        the resulting objects will be produced
      </p>

                 AnimGroupInstance         AnimInstance
                       (par)               (template: d)
                         |

        AnimInstance          AnimInstance
   (template: clone of b)  (template: clone of c)
</pre>
      <div class="feedbackWanted">
        <p>
          What animations should be cloned? I think you should just clone the
          DOM elements, not animations applied via script / CSS. Then, you can
          define a :hover animation and it will apply on the individual clones
          as you'd expect. Likewise for SVG. You clone the &lt;animate&gt;
          element, then if it has begin="click" each individual clone will
          respond as you expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you really want them all to start at once, you can set up
          a syncbase / event-base relationship, or a stylesheet rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          SVG 1.1 says, "animations on a referenced element will cause the
          instances to also be animated" which is conveniently ambiguous and
          implemented differently in WebKit and Gecko.

      <h2>Integration with Media Fragments</h2>
      <p>
        The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGMENTS]] defines a means
        for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
        The application of the temporal parameters to documents with the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a> 
        [[!SVG11] is as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If there is a begin time, seek the document controller to
            the begin time at the earliest of two moments: when the document
            begins to play or document load.
            <p class="note">
              Note that seeking behavior is well-defined even when the document
              has yet to start.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>If there is an end time, set a flag on the controller to say
            auto-pause at the given time.</li>
        <li>Any calls to seek / pause / play etc. on that controller clear the
            flag.</li>
        <li>If the controller reaches (or passes) the end time and the flag is
            still set, call pause and clear the flag.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="todo">
        What happens if the fragment is changed after the document has loaded
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note that media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
        their MIME type.
        As a result, temporal addressing may not have any effect for SVG content
        that is served in a document with a MIME type other than the SVG MIME
        type such as SVG embedded in HTML.
